		    <h2>PERSONAL SUMMARY</h2>
		    <p class="points">
		    A multi-skilled Maintenance Technician with a strong technical background who possesses self-discipline and the ability to work with the minimum of supervision. A productive team player, able to work to deadlines and targets, self-motivated, organized and able to multi task. Experienced in both production environment and hardware related test areas.
		    Now looking for a new and challenging position, one which will make best use of my existing skills and offer an opportunity for continued professional growth. 
		
		    </br>
		    I’m working in semiconductor manufacturing for seven years now at the process/maintenance technician position, first working for vendor inside Intel fab and then moving directly to Intel. As Intel employee I’ve been trained in two different areas (different tools) getting extensive knowledge from both.  
            I managed to obtain L3 (level 3) Intel grade which is the highest possible in my situation. To progress with my career, I need to obtain higher level of education (L8 or higher). While discussing my feature in Intel with my direct managers few new paths of career development were presented to me and one of them is moving into engineering positions. 
            Looking at the list of modules being part of Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Software Development) course available at Springboard.ie I believe this course might be the perfect one for me to get necessary knowledge and experience so I can continue my professional growth.
            </br></br>Regards
